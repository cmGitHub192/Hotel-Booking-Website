# Hotel-Booking-Website üè®
This repository hosts the codebase for our hotel room reservation website. Our platform allows users to easily search for room availability, browse through detailed room descriptions and photos, and seamlessly make reservations. Leveraging a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.
Our website offers a user-friendly interface and robust functionality. Additionally, we've implemented an admin panel where hotel owners can efficiently manage their page, and update room availability, prices, and other details. With integrated PayPal API for secure payments, we ensure a smooth booking experience for our guests.
